Hi, I'm Yuedong Chen, also known as Donald around my friends. Currently I'm a Research Associate with [Institute for Media Innovation (IMI)](http://imi.ntu.edu.sg) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by Prof. [Jianfei Cai](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/asjfcai/). And I'm doing some interesting research projects related to Action Units and 3D Facial Reconstruction.

I obtained my Bachelor Degree and Master Degree from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2016 and 2018, respectively. During my master program, I was with the [iSEE](http://isee.sysu.edu.cn) Lab, and co-supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Xiaohua Xie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5YZ3kvoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Wei-Shi Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AwqDDGoAAAAJ&hl=en). That six years pasts by really very quickly, but it brings me lots of fantastic experience and shapes me into who I am today. 

My research interest are computer vision and deep learning. Specifically, I'm fascinated by Image Enhancement and Generation, Facial Analysis. Recently, Graph Representation Learning and Few-Shot Learning impressed me a lot.
